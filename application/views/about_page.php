                <p style="text-align: justify;color:#20303c;font-size: 120%;" class=" sc flow-text">In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TED Talks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized. (Subject to certain rules and regulations.)</p>

               TEDx was created in the spirit of TED's mission, "ideas worth spreading." The TEDx Program is designed to help communities, organizations, and individuals to spark conversation and connection through local TED-like experiences. At TEDxMACE, the TEDTalks video and live speakers will combine to spark deep discussion and connections in a small group. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events, including ours, are self-organized.</p>
